# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the different editions of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Advent of Code 2020

For the 2020 edition, I set myself the challenge to use a different programming language every day. Note that the languages for the individual days have been chosen arbitrarily in order to explore their capabilities for problems different from their usual application domains. For instance, Lua was definitely not well suited for the puzzles of day four due to its lack of regex and string split operations.

* Day 2: Solved using bash
* Day 3: Solved using Ruby 2.7
* Day 4: Solved using Lua 5.4
* Day 5: Solved using batch script
